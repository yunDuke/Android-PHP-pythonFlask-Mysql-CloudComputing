# Android-PHP-pythonFlask-Mysql-CloudComputing

This project includes three parts.


(1) Website based on python flask which connected to the remote Mysql.I did not put the username and password in these files to make it sercurity.
    what if you are interested with this project, you could email me and i will respon you with the details quickly.
    (use pip install python-*** to install the missing library you do not have in your own computer)
    
(2) Android part includes the google maps api and the restful api to parse data from website. It allow user to signup signin and logout. Also, choosing
    your destination could be down on the map layout. Go searching nearby, user could get the information of the parking lot. If you reserve some parking
    spaces, you will get an order which is encrpted. Because the new library i imported, if you want to excute it, please add jars first.One is the google-play-service,
    another is the Gson.jar
  
    
(3) Sensor part is done based on the RaspberryPi. I will not show you how to connect the pins in this document because they are so easy to be done.Keep
    detecting the status of the parking space means the data user seen is in time. If the car detected, the led light will be on. While before you would 
    like to park, please connected the BT-module on Raspberrypi and sent the order ref to the device. When it authenticated successfully, you will get the 
    perimission. While next time you could not park here any more. 
    
    some other details are the serial library on python which developed for the BT-Communicating. I did not post it.
    
    If you still have questions, please email me.
